# LDR_Sensor_visualization
LDR sensor, for AITU ST-2303 

# Simulated IoT Light Sensor Dashboard

This project demonstrates a simulated IoT system for monitoring light intensity.
Sensor data is generated in software, stored in a database, and visualized as a dashboard.

## Features
- Simulated IoT light sensor (LDR)
- MQTT-based data communication (conceptual)
- SQLite database storage
- Data visualization using Python
- No physical hardware required

## Technologies
- Python
- MQTT
- SQLite
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

## Notes
Sensor data was simulated due to the absence of physical hardware.
